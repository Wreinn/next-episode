# next-episode

A script I use to open the next episode of a locally downloaded show

* Update the constants before use
* The script assumes an episode filename structure that may need to be updated
* Episodes are searched for in the current working directory
* Windows OS is assumed for the script's media player command
* Make a windows shortcut for ease-of-use
